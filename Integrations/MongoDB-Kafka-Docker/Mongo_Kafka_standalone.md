### MongoDB - Kafka Connect - Standalone mode
In this document, we will discuss how to setup the connection between MongoDB and Kafka using mongodb-kafka connector by making on-prem and cloud VMs as a cluster.

So, what we need for this are: 1+ on-prem VMs, 1+ Cloud VMs.

So, now let's see how this can happen in a step-by-step approach.

1. Install Java
2. Install/Setup Kafka & Test Kafka Connections
3. Install MongoDB & Test MongoDB
4. Setup mongoDB-Kafka Connector
5. Explain Source-Sink Connectors and make config changes.
6. Insert into MongoDB using connector.
7. Final testing
